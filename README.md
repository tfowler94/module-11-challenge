# module-11-challenge

In this module, I was looking to achieve two deliverables:


- Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.


Deliverable 1 was achieved in the 'part_1_mars_news' notebook. In this notebook, I used beautifulsoup to extract elements from the website and stored the necessary data into a Python dictionary.


Deliverable 2 was achieved in the 'part_2_mars_weather' notebook. In this notebook, I created my own dataframe from the information I scraped using beautifulsoup and splinter. With this dataframe I was able to use matplotlib to analyze the weather data and show visuals.
